Looks like you have stumbled over my blog!
\
I am Johannes, an ML Engineer at [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/), where I help to make
*Neural Search* applications a pleasure to implement and deploy, by working on open-source [libraries](https://github.com/jina-ai/docarray) and [frameworks](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina).
\
Previously, I did some some [research](https://github.com/JohannesMessner/BoxTE) in the field of *Knowledge Graph Completion*, as part of my MSc at Oxford.

Here I occasionally write about machine learning, software engineering, neural search, and some other random stuff.


If you want to reach out, you can shoot me an [email](messnerjo@gmail.com), or find me
on [GitHub](https://github.com/JohannesMessner/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannes-messner/).
