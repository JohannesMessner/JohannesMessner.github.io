## Hi 👋

I am about to start as an AI Researcher at [Aleph Alpha](https://aleph-alpha.com/).

Before that, I:

- Co-founded GoldenSet, a (short-lived) startup for LLM evaluation

- Built open-source ML software at Jina AI, co-leading the [DocArray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) project

- Got my MSc in CS from Oxford, where I developed a novel embedding architecture for temporal knowledge graphs, [BoxTE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08970)

- Got my BSc in CS and Political Science from LMU Munich with a thesis on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, also spending a semester at ETH Zürich

- Was born and raised in the beautiful Italian Alps 🏞️
